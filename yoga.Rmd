I have been practicing yoga (in one discipline or another) since 2005. I earned my RYT-200 hour teaching certifiation in 2013, and have been teaching and growing my own practice ever since!

In addition to teaching in a studio capacity, I also offer private individual and group sessions. I have taught individuals recovering from injuries, to groups at bachlorette and wedding parties. If you're interested in hiring me for a private session, please feel free to contact me to learn more!
