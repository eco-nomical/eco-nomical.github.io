#### Welcome to my personal website! I am Elissa Cohen, currently a PhD student in Economics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/). My research combines decision research, labor and welfare research in public policy, and complexity economics to identify how emergent human behaviors impact macro-level policy decision making. 

#### Catch me (if you can) on the job market in 2021-2022.
