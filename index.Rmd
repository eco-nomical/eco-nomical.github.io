Welcome to my personal website! I am Elissa Cohen, a PhD student in Economics at American University. My research combines decision research, labor and welfare research in public policy, and complexity economics to identify how emergent human behaviors impact macro-level policy decision making. 

Catch me (if you can) on the job market in 2021-2022.
