#### I am an Economics Ph.D. Candidate at [American University](https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/). 

#### My research has two areas of focus. The first area combines decision research, labor and welfare research in public policy, and complexity economics to identify how emergent human behaviors impact macro-level policy decision making. Currently, with funding from the National Science Foundation, I am examining how individual-level heterogeneity in risk preferences across different choice contexts influences the direction of federal safety regulations.

#### The second area combines network theory and community development to examine how changes to the Community Reinvestment Act impacts banking networks and local development over time.


#### Catch me on the job market in 2022-2023.
