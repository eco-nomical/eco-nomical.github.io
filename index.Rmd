#### I am an Economics Ph.D. Candidate at [American University](https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/). 

#### My research combines decision research, labor and welfare research in public policy, and complexity economics to identify how emergent human behaviors impact macro-level policy decision making. Currently, I am focused on how individual-level heterogeneity in risk preferences across different choice contexts influences the direction of federal safety regulations.


#### Catch me on the job market in 2021-2022.
